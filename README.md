# awslib

If you work with Amazon Web Services a lot, there are a bunch of things that you end up wanting a *lot*. Upload an entire directory to S3, get a list of hosts by security group, that kind of thing. This is a very small library to enable you to do this from within python, on top of boto.

It's entirely possible that this is of interest only to us.
